## 📊 Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values, duplicates, and data types.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Removed irrelevant columns and formatted data.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed statistical summaries.  
   - Visualized key patterns using graphs and plots.  
   - Identified correlations between price, location, and property type.  

4. **Insights & Observations**  
   - Hosts with higher ratings often charge more.  
   - Entire homes/apartments are the most preferred by customers.  
   - Location and availability heavily influence pricing.

#  Airbnb Data Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Airbnb dataset to uncover key insights about pricing patterns, room availability, and host behavior. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, the project identifies trends and factors influencing listing prices and customer preferences.

---

##  Objectives
- To clean and preprocess the Airbnb dataset for analysis.  
- To perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  
- To understand the factors affecting Airbnb pricing and occupancy.  
- To visualize insights for better business understanding.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **IDE (optional):** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values, duplicates, and data types.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Removed irrelevant columns and formatted data.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed statistical summaries.  
   - Visualized key patterns using graphs and plots.  
   - Identified correlations between price, location, and property type.  

4. **Insights & Observations**  
   - Hosts with higher ratings often charge more.  
   - Entire homes/apartments are the most preferred by customers.  
   - Location and availability heavily influence pricing.

##  Key Insights
- Listings near popular areas have higher prices and occupancy.  
- Superhosts tend to receive better reviews and maintain consistent pricing.  
- Seasonal trends significantly impact bookings and revenue.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Price distribution across different property types.  
- Correlation heatmap between features.  
- Top 10 neighborhoods by average price.  
- Relationship between host rating and price.
